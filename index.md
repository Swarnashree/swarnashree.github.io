Hello! I am currently pursuing my Masters of Science degree in Intelligent Information Systems (LTI department) at [CMU](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/222227570/swarnashree-mysore-sathyendra).
Previously I worked as a technical associate at **Goldman Sachs**, Bangalore and contributed to some very interesting projects. I completed my BE Degree in Information Science and Engineering from [PES Institute of Technology](https://www.pes.edu/), Bangalore (Batch of 2014-2018). 
I'm most interested in tackling problems in the **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision** domains and building **scalable, secure** ML systems.

## Updates
- **31/08/2021** Started my degree at CMU ! :D
- **04/01/2021** Received a fast-track promotion to **Technical Associate** at Goldman Sachs
- **08/11/2019** Attending **Grace Hopper Celebration India 2019** as a Speaker, representing Goldman Sachs

## Select Projects
- **Real-time Person Detection in Videos based on Natural Language Description**
  - Built a working end-to-end system comprising of various modules that leveraged on deep learning models trained with fine-tuning. 
  - Modules: Human Figure Detection, Body Segmentation, Gender Detection, Clothing and Apparel Style Detection.
  - This project led to a publication at ADCOM 2018.

- **Factoid Based Question Answering System for Biology Coursebooks**
  <br/> Built a Q&A system using QANUS skeletal framework. Devised and implemented custom chunking and parsing algorithms. 
<br/><br/> **Please refer to CV for more details on various other projects**

## Professional Experience
- **Smart FAQ Chatbot**
  - Worked on building a smart FAQ chatbot that was trained on various FAQs in the Legal and Compliance domain. 
  - Took up complete ownership of the entire lifecycle of the product that also included building an efficient solution for retrieving answers for the questions (Implemented word-jumbling techniques, auto correct using hunspell, SVD for dimensionality reduction and ConceptNet based semantic parser).

- **Data Ingestion Pipeline**
  - Currently building an ingestion pipeline and one-stop store for division-wide data, reducing consumption time for downstream applications from 48 hours to less than 1 hour.
  - Leveraged Presto as query engine and spark optimizations, yarn for resource management
